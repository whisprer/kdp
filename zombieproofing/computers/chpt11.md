Chapter 8: Simple Operating Systems — Making Your Zombieproof Computer Actually Usable
So you’ve built a CPU, hooked up memory, and connected peripherals. Congratulations, you now have the rudiments of a functional computer—just like the mythical devices whispered of in pre-apocalypse times! But raw hardware is like a wild dog: it needs training and organization to become your loyal companion.

Enter the operating system (OS)—the indispensable software layer that manages the hardware, runs programs, and provides a user-friendly way to interact with the machine. This chapter explores what operating systems are, why they’re essential, and guides you in creating a simple OS to bridge your hardware and your survival needs.

What Is an Operating System?
An OS is a collection of software routines that:

Manage hardware resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices

Provide a way to load, run, and manage programs

Facilitate communication with input/output devices

Handle file storage, execution control, and error management

Without an OS, users must command the machine directly at the binary level—a headache of cosmic proportions.

OS Components in a Nutshell
Bootloader: Tiny initial program that prepares the CPU and memory to load the OS itself.

Kernel: The core that talks directly to hardware and manages resources.

File System: Organizes storage so you can save and retrieve data easily.

Device Drivers: Specialized code to communicate with peripherals.

Shell/User Interface: Allows users to run commands, start programs, and run scripts.

Building a Minimal OS for Your Zombieproof Computer
Step 1: The Bootloader
Stored in ROM or initial memory region.

Initializes system state, sets up stack, and loads kernel from memory or storage into RAM.

Step 2: Kernel Design
Handles interrupts — special signals from hardware peripherals or timers.

Implements simple scheduler to switch between program tasks.

Provides basic memory management and input/output control.

Step 3: Simple Shell
Command line interface to execute programs, list files, and control peripherals.

Support basic commands like run, load, save, and exit.

How to Write OS Code
Your OS will be written in low-level languages such as assembly or C-like code, carefully tailored to your CPU’s instruction set.

Start small, with routines to initialize hardware and respond to keyboard input.

Use interrupts to handle asynchronous events like ticking clocks and peripheral signals.

Implement basic file handling if your system has storage.

Survival Project: Writing and Loading a Tiny OS
Write bootloader to initialize hardware and load kernel.

Develop kernel to respond to keyboard and timer interrupts.

Create shell for basic file handling and program execution.

Test system by running simple user programs (print text, echo input).

Why Your Zombieproof Computer Needs an OS
Automates routine tasks, so you can focus on survival strategies, not flipping bits manually.

Abstracts hardware complexities for better modular programming and expansion.

Enables multitasking and efficient resource management—critical when zombies are knocking.

Operating systems are the glue and brain interface between raw hardware and practical use. By building one tailored to your design, you gain full command over your zombieproof computer’s capabilities.
