Chapter 16: Memory Management and DMA — Efficient Data Flow in Your Zombieproof Computer

To truly survive and help build civilization anew, your zombieproof computer needs to handle memory efficiently and move data rapidly without choking the CPU. This chapter delves into the design of memory management units, direct memory access (DMA), and techniques that optimize throughput.

Memory Management Principles
Memory mapping: Assign fixed or dynamic addresses to memory regions, peripherals, and I/O devices.

Paging and segmentation (simplified): Organize memory to separate code, data, stack, and peripherals for safety and ease.

Address decoding circuits: Hardware logic to select correct memory blocks based on CPU address lines.

Direct Memory Access (DMA)
DMA controllers enable peripherals to read/write main memory independently, reducing CPU load.

Ideal for high-speed data transfers (disk I/O, network packets, video buffers).

Requires careful management of bus arbitration to avoid conflicts.

Designing DMA in Zombieproof Machines
Build simple DMA logic with finite state machines that handle memory access cycles.

Use interrupts or status registers to signal completion of transfers.

Ensure synchronization mechanisms between CPU and DMA to prevent data corruption.

Survival Optimization
Add memory protection to prevent buggy code from overwriting critical regions.

Design for minimal power consumption in memory cycling and DMA operations.

Use buffers to smooth out bursty data loads.

Survival Project: Implementing Basic DMA
Design state-machine logic for DMA read/write cycles.

Program CPU to initiate DMA transfers and handle completion interrupts.

Test with block data transfers between I/O and RAM, verifying integrity.

Mastering memory management and DMA equips your zombieproof computer with smart data flows, freeing up CPU cycles and making complex tasks survivable under apocalypse constraints.
